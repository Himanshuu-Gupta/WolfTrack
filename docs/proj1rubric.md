|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3| |
| Number of commits|3|In GH |
| Number of commits: by different people|3|in GH|
| Issues reports: there are **many**| 3|In GH  |
|  issues are being  closed|3 |Evidence in GH |

|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 3| |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3 | |
| Use of version control tools| 3| |
|Use of  style checkers |3 |config files in GH showing your config|

| test cases exist|3||
| test cases are routinely executed|3 |e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3| |
| issues are discussed before they are closed| 2| |
| Chat channel: exists| 3| We have a discord channel |
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|2 |if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3| |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3| |
